## About Me:
My name is Christina and I am 22 years old. From an early age, i loved sports, namely judo. In 2013, she entered the Olympic Reserve School in Vitebsk, where she reformed a sports category: candidate for master of sports in judo and sambo. Then she also wanted to connect her life with sports, so in 2017 she entered the Polotsk State University for full-time education, studied in the specialty "Physical Culture". University graduated in 2021. Then in the same year she entered the magistracy of the same university in the specialty "Physical Culture and Sports" and also successfully graduated. At the moment I have been working in the Federal Sports Complex in Novopolotsk as an instructor-methodologist for physical culture and health and sports work for one year.
There are also new interests in the field of IT. Trying to find myself. Of course, there is not as much free time as I would like, but I believe in myself and I believe that I can handle everything! I am sure that my ability to learn and achieve my goals will help me become an experienced specialist in my chosen field.
